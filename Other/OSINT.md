## Samantha Zephyr Williams

Samantha Zephyr Williams is a skilled computer science graduate and game developer with a passion for virtual reality and gaming. She is known in the OASIS as "sam4nexpl01t3r" and has gained a reputation as a fierce warrior in the virtual arena. Can you track her social media presence, which she uses to connect with fellow gamers and share updates on her OASIS egg-hunting adventures?

## Solution

Based on the description we can gather a couple of things

- Her full name: Samantha Zephyr Williams
- Her username: sam4nexpl01t3r
- She is a skilled computer science graduate
- She develops games

I used a website called [OSINTFRAMEWORK](https://www.example.com) , this website provides a plethora of tools to help find information about people. 

I decided to start with trying to find accounts related to her username using [this](https://instantusername.com/#/) website that I found via [OSINTFRAMEWORK](https://www.example.com).
Entering her username we find that a lot of accounts have been made with the her username, after going through a couple of the websites and not finding much. I ended up on her twitter which led me to a ton useful information. 

The first thing that jumped to my eyes was QR code which I ended up scanning and it contained the flag!

Before ending this solution I would like to list a couple of things before I ended up scanning the QR code. 

1.  I used [tineye](https://tineye.com/) to try and reverse image search her profile picture for any useful information. In this case I was only able to find information related to one of favorite video games.
2. On her twitter, she linked her [blog](https://t.co/ywzLYML1F4). On her blog she put her CV with an email as well as plenty of other information, I didnt look too far into where she went to school and her workplaces as I didnt think it would lead me anywheres.
3. Her CV contained an email which I used to look around for information, it did not lead me any further.
4. Lastly, I put her blog into [waybackmachine](https://archive.org/web/) to see if there was any archives of her website. 


## Way back to the future 
Mr. Ellwood did not know that even if he deleted his post, you can dig up his mysteries.

## Solution
This description did not give me much information other than a last name and the fact that he had deleted posts. 

The first thing I began with doing was simply looking up the last name to see if anyone came up. And for the most part no relevant information came up. I spent a lot of time looking around and finding absolutely nothing.
Until I ended up looking up **ellwood HTB** on google and I found a linkedin account of a man named Dylon Ellwood. I instantly knew I was at the right place because linkedin has a **People also viewed** section, in this section there was a HTB employee which was a tell tale sign I was looking in the right place.

Looking around on his linkedin I found out a decent amount of useful information but noticeably I got an email address as well as his blog. 

Based on the description of the problem I thought it would be a good idea to check the archives of his blog using [waybackmachine](https://archive.org/web/) to check for previous versions of it.

I eventually found the flag on the first version of his blog. 

Had I not found the flag on his blog I think the next step would have been to use his email to see if I can pull any information from it or check the archives of his linkedin account.

There is also a website named [pimeyes](https://pimeyes.com/en) that I could have used to search his face to see if he had other pictures of himself online.
