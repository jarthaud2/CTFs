## Description:
Where is the picture taken?
The flag format is TsukuCTF23{latitude_longitude}.
Round fractions to the nearest fourth decimal place and answer the third decimal place.

## What I did

I started with just putting the image in Yandex to see if I could find anything related as this is clearly a pedestrian walking bridge which might have some images already online from people who have been there.  

The initial Yandex search was not coming up with anything so instead I tried searching for suspension bridges close to the locations of the Yandex suggestions. This also was not helping.

To find the answer, I screenshotted the main building on the right of the image with the green roofing, this is what lead me to the location of the bridge.

This is an image of the Momijidani Suspension Bridge


## Answer

After finding the bridge on google maps, the coordinates can be found by simply going up the road until you are lined up with the white rhombi on the road.
